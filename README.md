This Repository consists of the project tasks which I have been assigned by Codsoft during my internship in Artificial Intelligence

TASK-1: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED To Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

TASK-2: TIC-TAC-TOE AI To Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

TASK-4: RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM To Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.

TASK-5: FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION To Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
